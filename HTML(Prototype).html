        <h1>Historical Perspective on Computing: Discuss the evolution of computing </h1>

            <p>Looking back at time, computing goes way back onto the old times. For example, the abacus is a simple babylonian ivention that uses beads as a way of calculating.  Moving to the 19th century where in Joseph Marie Jacquard made the "Jacquard Machine" which inspired the following development of computers, it is an automated loom that uses punch cards to automatically weaves silk cloth.</p>
                <br>
            <p>In 1820's, Charles Babbage  started his first invention called the "Difference Engine" which was powered by steam, this project however failed because the lack of funding from the government. Years later, he made his own second invention called "Analytical Engine" which has been discussed as the first programmable computer using punch cards. At this time, Charles met Ada Lovelace(Deemed to be the First Programmer), Lovelace became interested to the project of Charles Babbage which she helped by creating an algorithm to help calculate Bernoullis Numbers.</p>
                <br>
            <p>In 1942, John Atanasoff and his student Clifford Berry made the first digital computer.</p>
                <br>
            <p>1942, The Colossus Mark I was invented in collaboration with Alan Turing (Father of Modern Computer Science and AI| also deciphered the enigma code using Bombe) which deciphers the german encrypted messages during world war II. It is considered to be the first fully programable digital computer. </p>
                <br>
            <p>In 1945, the ENIAC (Electronic Number Integrator and Computer) was invented by John Mauchly and J. Presert Ecker. The ENIAC was declared as the first electronic digital computer. Despite being programmable, its process to calculate took long as wires needed to be rewired for a new set of calculation. Around this time, Jon Von Neumann an American Mathematician, proposed the "Jon Neumann Architecture" which founded how computers of today was built. In addition, he helped in creating the EDVAC (Electronic Discrete Variable Automatic Computer) which has a stored program or instructions in the computer which became a principle when designing modern computers.</p>
                <br>
            <p>1947 - Transistors were invented which replaced vacuum tubes as it is more efficient and consumed less power. These </p>
                <br>
            <p>1954 - Fortran, one of the first high-level programming language that was widely used in its time.</p>
                <br>
            <p>1960's - 1990's The arpanet paved the way for what we use today, the internet, which connects different computers and is able to transmit information from one computer to another. An example would be packet switching.</p>

        <h1> Introduction to IT Basics: Provide an overview of fundamental IT concepts,</h1>
            <h3>(1) hardware,</h3> 

                <p>- Hardware is a physical components of a computer that is used to either entering data using an input device(e.g.Keyboard, Mouse, Microphone,) or presenting the product of the data by an output device (e.g. Speaker, Monitor, Printer). The input data that was entered by the input device will then be stored and processed by the processing components of the computer (e.g. RAM, cpu, gpu, ssd/harddisk, which would then present or display the output data/product using a output device. </p>
                    <br>
            <h3>>(2) software,</h3>
                <p>- Software is a application that is a set of programmed code that acts as instructions for the computer to follow. There are two types of software applications 1. Application Software and 2. Systems Software. [APPLICATION SOFTWARE] is used to make everyday life faster and efficient compared to the traditional ways of doing task which would take a longer time compared to using an application. [SYSTEMS SOFTWARE] focuses on the operating system of the computer (e.g. windows, macOS, linux), drivers, utilities. The primary purpose of operating system is to help managing computer data  and help softwares communicate with hardwares.</p>
                    <br>
            <h3>(3) networking,</h3>
                <p>- Networking is the connection between computers for the purpose of sending, sharing, or storing information/resources from one computer(e.g. personal desktop) to another(e.g. mobile phone, internet, server,)  which could be done through a physically using a cable or wirelessly by signals.</p>
                    <br>
            <h3>(4) role of IT in modern organizations.</h3>
                <p>- IT generally reduces our workload by making tasks automated which makes accomplishing faster and more efficient, but what are its role in modern organizations of today? Todays organizations uses Information Technology to increase productivity and effiency in work enabling the organization to allocate some of the resources to other work. Data management along Cybersecurity is another example that most big organization have. With the large volume of data that the big organizations gathers, stores, and processes, they would have to protect it from getting stolen from hacking or data breaching by enforcing a cyber security system as it is a valuable assets of the organization, it would take them a long time if they were to manually compute all of the data so they implement the uses of Information technology in their work to ensure progress.</p>
